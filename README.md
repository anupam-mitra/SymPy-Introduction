# SymPy Introduction

This repository contains a few jupyter notebooks to introduce `sympy` (https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), a python computer algebra library.

Some examples are based on [this repository](https://github.com/jarthurgross/symbolic-algebra-lesson) which was used in the [CQuIC Computing Workshop in the summer of 2017](https://cquic.github.io/summer17-computing-workshop/).
